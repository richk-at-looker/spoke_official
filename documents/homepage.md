# Hub and Spoke Demonstration

## 1. Introduction

This project provides an introductory example of:
- [Hub and Spoke Models](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pk1iv40FWJU)
- [Remote Project Import](https://docs.looker.com/data-modeling/learning-lookml/importing-projects).

The spoke codebase is very simple, it is namely:
- A single model file which exposes an imported Explore from the hub

## 2. Project Import

The intention of this spoke project is to demonstrate importing and exposing a file from a hub project, with no other modifications
