# Hub and Spoke Demonstration

## 1. Introduction

This project provides an introductory example of:
- [Hub and Spoke Models](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pk1iv40FWJU)
- [Remote Project Import](https://docs.looker.com/data-modeling/learning-lookml/importing-projects).

The hub codebase is very simple, it is namely:
- A single view file (order_items) which uses LookML refinements to add a description, vs. the autogenerated view
- A single Explore file, that exposes this view file as an Explore labelled "Sales Data"

## 2. Project Import

The intention of this Hub project is for to to be imported, using Lookers remote project import. 
- Once imported, the files within can be accessed by model files within the importing project
